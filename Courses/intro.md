# Introduction to Programming with Scratch

## Intro
Welcome to 8-Bit University's, "Introduction to Programming with Scratch". We're excited to get you started.
This course is meant to be hands-on and will get you familiar with basic programming and computational thinking skills while making games.
Each project you accomplish will be shared with the community for feedback and testing. These experiences will further improve your problem-solving skills and logical thinking.

**Keep in mind the following:**
- Allow yourself to make mistakes and learn from them
- There’s no “one” correct solution for anything
- If you come across a problem, try to figure out how to solve it yourself
- If you really can’t solve it, try asking for help

### About Scratch
[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is a free and open-source browser-based programming language developed by MIT. It has a block-based programming interface, where you can drag and drop blocks to create animations and games. This makes it easy for anyone to get started.
You might be wondering why we're using Scratch. Isn't it for kids? Well, it's suitable for all ages and backgrounds and a perfect platform to get started. While it may not look like much, Scratch is quite powerful with a huge community.
Let's take a look and play some games made by a famous "scratcher" (those who use scratch call themselves that) known as [griffpatch](https://www.youtube.com/@griffpatch). Griffpatch is the creator of [Paper Minecraft](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10128407/) & [Geometry Dash](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/105500895/).

### Using Scratch
Let's head over to the website and watch the video while you're at it.
1. You'll need to create an account to get started.
2. Once you've created an account, click on the "Create" button at the top bar.
3. The screen will be loading and you'll be taken to the IDE.
4. Click on the "Tutorials" button at the top bar
5. You'll be taken to a page filled with video thumbnails. The very first video you see should be called, "Getting Started". Click on it.
6. You'll be taken back to the IDE. Click the "play" button. You might want to resize the video.
7. Once you're done with the video, let's try what was suggested in the video. Click on the "green arrow button" which will go to the next step.
8. Try to see what happens when you drag and drop the blocks as instructed in the tutorials.
9. You can keep clicking the "green arrow button" and follow the steps until it's done. It should say "More things to try!".

Scratch has in-built tutorials that would help you to get started.
Before we dive deep into the tutorials, let's try to understand the IDE.
- On the left is a list of blocks. Scroll down to take a look at them and see what they do.
- The biggest empty area is where the programming happens. You can drag the blocks and connect them to each other. Take note that the code will run from the top to the bottom.
- On the right, you'll see a cat, that's Scratch! Scratch will follow your every command. Scratch is in an area called "the stage". You can maximize the stage with the button
- At the bottom right, you'll see a "cat" button. Hover your mouse over it and you'll see a few different options. Click on it and you'll be taken to a bunch of pictures. These are called sprites. They're like Scratch where you can program them. For now, let's go back by pressing the "back" button.
- At the button next to the cat icon, you'll see a "picture" button. Hover your mouse over it and you'll see a few different options. Click on it and you'll be taken to a bunch of background images. For now, let's go back by pressing the "back" button.
- Click and drag on Scratch. You'll notice the values change, specifically the "x" and "y" values. This is how you can tell Scratch where to move.
You may watch them and try as much as you'd like. When you're done, you can come back here to continue the course.
