# Introduction to Programming with Scratch

### Intro
Welcome to 8-Bit University's, "Introduction to Programming with Scratch". We're excited to get you started.
This course is meant to be hands-on and will get you familiar with basic programming and computational thinking skills while making games.
Each project you accomplish will be shared with the community for feedback and testing. These experiences will further improve your problem-solving skills and logical thinking.

**Keep in mind the following:**
- Allow yourself to make mistakes and learn from them
- There’s no “one” correct solution for anything
- If you come across a problem, try to figure out how to solve it yourself
- If you really can’t solve it, try asking for help

Let's take a moment to understand what's going on

![Scratch areas](https://i.imgur.com/pR7ZUht.jpg)

**Blocks menu**
- Click on any colored circle in the blocks menu
- This is a shortcut that will take you to what you're looking for

**Blocks list**
- This is where you can find the blocks of code

**Script area**
- This is where you can drag the blocks to combine them

**Start/Stop**
- This is how you can start and stop your program

**Stage**
- This is how the program will look like to users
- There is a maximize button that you can use if it's too small
- The cat in the middle of the stage is Scratch

**Sprite zones**
- This will be where all your sprites are shown

### Coordinates
- Click the button on the bottom right.
- if you hover over it, it will show "Choose a backdrop"

- This is how you'll know where Scratch is moving

### Sprite info

Let's take a look at the area below the stage

- You'll notice that Scratch is currently labeled as "Sprite1"
- Scratch is currently located at: x is 0 and y is 0
- You can also see the size and direction
- Try moving scratch around to see what's reflected in this area

### Assignment - Create a story animation

Choose the following
- 2 sprites
- A background
- A sound effect

What to do
- Get the sprites to interact with each other
- The sprites can move or change size

You may look at the tutorial for ideas.
