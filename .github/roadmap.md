We'll be building the course in a few stages and we're looking out for contributions. For now, here are the stages of how this course will go.

Stage one takes place entirely on github to setup the main courses. Curriculum research and outline will be needed.

## Stage two
Stage two will be mostly about community engagement and setting up an interactive website
